* props and states are used to pass data inside React components. 
 - Props (  or, properties ) are inputs passed down from a parent component to its child component.
 - States are variables defined and managed inside the components

######
export default function ParentComponent() {
    return (
        <>
            <ChildCmp1
                name="GB"
                age={100}
                nickname={["GB","GOD"]}
                child2={ChildCmp2} /* you can even pass a function into props !!! */
            />
            <ChildCmp2 />
            <ChildCmp3 />
            <ChildCmp4 />
        </>
    );
}

function ChildCmp1(props) {
    return <h1> my name is { props.name } and I am { props.age } years old. {props.child2()}</h1>
...

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️if you pass anyting other than a string as prop value, you need to put the value in curly brackets.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
(numbers, functions, arrays, objects......)

* props ar immutable.
prop's value can't be changed no matter what happens.
