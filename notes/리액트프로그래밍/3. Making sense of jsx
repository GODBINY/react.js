I learned that a component must always have a return statement that contatins element to render on the screen.

////
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>
}
////

the tag <h1> looks like a regular HTML tag, but it's actually a special template language included in React called JSX.
JSX is a syntax extension that produces JavaScript powered HTML elements.
Javascript variables can be returned from function calls.

////
function App(){
  const myElement = <h1>hi</h1>
  return myElement
}
