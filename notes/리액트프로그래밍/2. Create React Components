* in react, component is a single independent unit of a user interface.
A component is made up of a function that returns a single UI element.


#App.jsx
function App () {
  return null
}
export default App

=> when you want a component to render nothing, you can return a null or false instead of an element.

* what is .jsx?
=> It's an exetention of JavaScript that produces JavaScript-powered HTML elements.
=> JSX (JavaScript XML, formally JavaScript Syntax eXtension) is a JavaScript extension that allows creation of Document Object Model (DOM) trees using an XML-like syntax.
=> none-pure js file 

* a component must always return a single element. when you need to return multiple elements, you need to wrap all of them in a single element like a <div>.
return (
    <div>
      <h1>element1</h1>
      <h2>element2</h2>
    <div>
)

BUT this will make your application render one extra <div> element in the browser.
to avoid this clutter, you can use an empty tag <>

return (
  <>
    <h1>element1</h1>
    <h2>element2</h2>
  </>
)

the empty tag above is a React feature called a "Fragment".
